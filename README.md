# Fake-News-Detection-using-ML-Models
The notebook demonstrates fake news detection using Python with decision tree, logistic regression, and random forest models. It preprocesses true and fake news datasets, cleans and vectorizes text with TF-IDF, and trains the models. The workflow includes data reshuffling, cleaning, and evaluating model performance for classification accuracy.
